      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog!I am Pravin Babhu S, a software engineer by
        profession.I love playing around with code.I am gaining experience in
        ASP.NET and frontend frameworks like Angular and React. Not only
        software excites me but generally the science and technology(a tech
        enthusiast).I have done my post graduation in Electronics and
        Communication Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love motorcycles and automobiles.I own a Kawasaki Ninja
        ZX10R(Just kidding!I am never gonna buy one even if I can afford it in
        the future.)I ride a Bajaj Discover 125.This friend aids me in my daily
        commute to office.I am truly fascinated by Internal Combustion
        Engines(ICE) and the modern electronics namely the Anti-Lock Braking
        System(ABS),Traction Control System(TCS) and other slew of
        electronics.Not to forget the Engine Control Unit(ECU).
      </p>

        I enjoy watching films in the weekend.Just a film not a binge
        watcher.They have also been my source of knowledge.By the way, this
        habit was inculcated to me by my brother.
      </p>
